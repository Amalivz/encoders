    <h2 id="headings"> Brief History of Soccer</h2>
    <p id="para1">Soccer, or better known to the rest of the world as football, is one of the oldest sports in history.<br> Dating back to 206 B.C., there are accounts of Chinese soldiers playing Tsu’chu, “kicking the ball,”<br> to supplement their training regiments during the Han Dynasty. While many other ancient <br>cultures played games involving a ball, Tsu’chu was the first to not allow hands. Goals consisted <br>of a net attached to two bamboo poles and elevated 30 feet in the air. This is quite the contrast<br> to modern goals that sit on the ground and extend eight feet high and 24 feet wide.<br> The particular style of playing a game with a ball, centered around one’s feet, spread throughout the <br>world. </p>
