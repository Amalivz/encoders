            Frenkie de Jong was born in Arkel (Netherlands) on May 12, 1997. The Barça player started his career at Willem <br>
            II in the Eredivise, the Dutch first division. In 2016 he signed for Ajax, where he gradually gained a place in the <br>
            starting eleven. His versatility and his great vision allowed him to become the midfield organiser for the team <br>
            from Amsterdam.

        <p>De Jong began his professional career at Willem II in 2015. He transferred to Ajax for a fee worth €1 a year <br>
            later. The fee was symbolic and offset by a sell-on clause. At Ajax he established himself as one of the best <br>
            young midfielders in Europe, after winning a domestic double and reaching the Champions League semi-<br>
            finals. De Jong won the Eredivisie and KNVB Cup, was Eredivisie player of the season, and was an <br>
            instrumental part of Ajax's first UEFA Champions League semi-final appearance in 22 years, in a <br>
            breakthrough 2018 to 19 season.
