            The striker from Poland stands out for his goalscoring abilities. Inside the box he has all the tools to make him <br>
            a difficult striker to read as he can find the net with his head and both feet with equal precision.

        <p>After being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszków, Lewandowski <br>
            moved to top-flight Lech Poznań, helping the team win the 2009 to 2010 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to <br>
            Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top <br>
            goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. Prior <br>
            to the start of the 2014to 2015 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, <br>
            on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski <br>
            was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019-2020 as part of a treble. He is one of only two <br>
            players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all <br>
            three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer.
