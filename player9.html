            At the end of 2014 he signed his first professional contract with French club Rennes. He made his Ligue 1 <br>
            debut at just the age of 17 and he scored his first goal against Girondins. His progress attracted the attention of <br>
            Borussia Dortmund and he signed for the Bundesliga club in the summer of 2016. Dembélé adapted quickly to <br>
            German football, scoring 12 goals and providing 20 assists in his first season.

            <h2 id="career">Career</h2>
        <p>Dembélé began his career at Rennes before joining Borussia Dortmund in 2016. He won the DFB-Pokal with <br>
            Dortmund in the 2016 to 17 season, scoring a goal in the final. A year later, he transferred to Barcelona for an <br>
            initial fee of €105 million, becoming at the time the joint-second most expensive footballer ever alongside <br>
            compatriot Paul Pogba. Dembélé subsequently won the double of La Liga and Copa del Rey in an injury-<br>
            riddled first season in Spain.
